# Feasibility Report

## Requirements
{Clarified requirements from spec and user Q&A. Numbered list. Each item: what is required and why.}

## Codebase Investigation
{Detailed findings from codebase analysis, organized by concern area:
- If any concrete investigation target was specified in the spec, you must clarify the answer/result for it.
- Relevant existing implementations and reusable components (cite file paths)
- Interfaces, contracts, and patterns to conform to
- Impact scope: modules/files affected by the change
- Test landscape: existing test coverage and patterns
- Gaps: missing capabilities or areas needing new implementation}

## External Research
{Findings from web research, organized by topic:
- Best practices and recommended patterns (with source URLs)
- Library/API documentation and version constraints
- Known solutions and reference implementations
- Retrieval dates for time-sensitive information}

## Approach Candidates
{Each candidate as a subsection:
### Candidate {N}: {name}
- Summary: {concise description}
- Pros: {advantages}
- Cons: {disadvantages and risks}
}

## Selected Approach
{Chosen approach with selection rationale. Reference candidate name.
If PoC was conducted: hypothesis tested, method, key results, and evidence that influenced the decision.}

## Assumptions & Constraints
{Technical constraints, environmental dependencies, scope boundaries, risks identified during investigation. Numbered list.}
