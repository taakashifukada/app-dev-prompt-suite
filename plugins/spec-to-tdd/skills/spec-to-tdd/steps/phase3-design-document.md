# Phase 3 — Solution Design Document

1. Read the critical files identified during Phase 1-2 to verify your understanding before finalizing the design.
2. Save a design document following the [solution design template](solution-design-template.md) as a Markdown file:
   - Path: `<project-root>/.claude/claudeRes/docs/<YY_MM_DD>_solution_design_<name>.md` (create the directory if it does not exist)
   - Reference existing functions and utilities to reuse, with their file paths.
3. Summarize the design in smart and easy-to-understand manner and display it to terminal
4. Submit the document to the user for review and approval. Incorporate any revisions and confirm the final plan.
5. Ask the user whether to run `/compact` before starting Phase 4.
   - Context: The design document is saved to disk and will be re-read by the implementation phase, so compacting is safe at this point.
