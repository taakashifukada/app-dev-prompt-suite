# Phase 4 — TDD Implementation

1. Propose a feature branch name and location. Either create it or prompt the user to create it manually, then check out.
2. Hand off the approved design document to `tdd-implementer` subagent. Ask implementing subtasks in precedence-diagram order by TDD manner.
3. Report completion to the user. Save a final report as `<project-root>/.claude/claudeRes/docs/<YY_MM_DD>_dev_final_<name>.md`.
    - Append a PR description section at the end: **Background**, **Main Changes**, **Notes** — each 3-6 lines, 10 lines max.

# Rules
- If TDD is overkill, inform user and propose simpler approach with approval.
- Always be mindful of the DRY principle.
