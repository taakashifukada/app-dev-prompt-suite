# Phase 2 — Solution Design

1. Design the implementation approach based on Phase 1 findings. Provide comprehensive context (file paths, code patterns, constraints) from Phase 1 exploration.
2. Present the implementation approach to the user and get approval.
   - If the user requests a PoC, invoke `poc-feasibility-expert` subagent, then present results, back to 2.
3. Finalize implementation items. Break them into subtasks and map dependencies using a precedence diagram.
4. Present the subtask list with the precedence diagram to the user and get approval.
