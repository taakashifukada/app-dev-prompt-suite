# Codebase & Research Investigation

Launch 4 parallel Task agents:

1. **Task 1** (Explore agent): Find similar implementations
   - Search for patterns, components, or modules similar to the feature spec
   - Note reusable code and established conventions

2. **Task 2** (Explore agent): Investigate test patterns
   - Find existing test conventions relevant to this task
   - Identify test utilities, fixtures, and patterns to follow

3. **Task 3** (Explore agent): Identify impact scope
   - Map files and components affected by this feature
   - Check for downstream dependencies and side effects

4. **Task 4** (web-research-expert agent): Research best practices
   - Search for industry best practices, library documentation, and known solutions
   - Include version info and retrieval date in findings

Merge results into comprehensive analysis. Update metrics: `files_analyzed` count.
